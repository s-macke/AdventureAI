You are the one who gets to pretend to be my boyfriend.\n\nWe proceed by you typing what you want to do.  Don't get cute: type a verb, or a verb and noun, or maybe verb-noun-preposition-noun.  The following are examples of things you can do:\n\nWRITE\nEXAMINE DESK (or X DESK)\nTAKE ITINERARY\nOPEN DRAWER\nSTAND ON CHAIR\nLOOK UNDER DESK\nPUT ITINERARY ON CABINET\n\nI'll report what happens, and we go from there.  You can probably trip me up if you try to be an arse about it, but what's the fun of that?\n\nYou can see an inventory of what you are holding at any time by typing I or EXAMINE ME (X ME).  If you want a summary description of the room you're in, just LOOK.\n\nYou can save the game by typing SAVE, and restore a saved game by typing RESTORE.  I'll be desolate if you QUIT.\n\nWhat else?  CREDITS and COPYRIGHT are available whenever.  If you're ever stuck, I can give you a HINT.   If you want to take back your last action, UNDO bends space-time to your regretful will.\n\nFinally: you are male by default (curse you, patriarchy!).  I'm not changing my gender on your behalf, but you are welcome to change yours.  Just type FEMALE or, more stylishly, HETERONORMATIVITY OFF.\n\nI would wish you luck, but you don't need luck.
