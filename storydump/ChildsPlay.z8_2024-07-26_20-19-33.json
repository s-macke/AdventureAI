She is carrying that little red haired girl Zoe who started coming to playgroup a couple of whiles ago. Zoe sees your favorite toy and her eyes light up.\n\nThe mom must be psychic or something because she whirls around and snatches up your favorite toy. \"Oh, no,\" she says with a little laugh, \"we're not having you two fight over this thing again. I'll tuck it away where it'll be safe.\" And Marion laughs too, which is cool, that way they don't notice you and the little red haired girl glaring at each other.\n\nShe wants your toy? And the mom wants to lock the toy away? Bring it on.\n\nChapter 1\nPlaytime\n\nRight behind Marion and Zoe the little red haired girl is Lisa who is Cassie's mom. Lisa is carrying Cassie all carefully but Cassie is squirming to get down. \"Hi Farina, hi Marion--hang on Cassie, mommy's going to put you down,\" Lisa says and then she steps over the baby gate and dumps Cassie by the couch to the south of you.\n\nMeanwhile the mom is putting all the pillows back on the couch and loveseat. As she finishes she asks Marion, \"Can I put this toy in Zoe's backpack for now?\" Marion is all \"Sure!\" as she puts Zoe on the floor over by the rocking chair and sits on the loveseat.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by ten points.]\n\n\u003e",

It is Becca and her son Jemison and some strange guy is there holding Watson Mason. \"Come on in, everyone,\" the mom says. She turns to the strange guy, \"I'm glad you could make it, Parry.\"\n\nParry shrugs and smiles and says, \"I always wondered what everyone did during playgroup.\"\n\n\"Drink mimosas!\" Becca says over her shoulder to Parry and there is polite laughter and Parry smiles like he is kinda unsure about all of this.\n\n\"Why don't you put Watson in here with the others?\" the mom asks and Parry nods. He ends up putting Watson by Jemison over by the loveseat. Then all the standing adults sit down so now I guess they are sitting adults.\n\n\u003e",
