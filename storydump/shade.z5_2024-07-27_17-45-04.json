A second-hand stereo sits on a cardboard crate. A kitchen nook one way and a bathroom nook the other, with a closet to the side. A broad mirror tries to make the place seem twice its size; it halfway works. One window, whose shade is down, and the front door firmly shut.\n\nThe place is still too dim, except the corner where the desk lamp is somehow too bright.\n\nYour luggage is piled untidily by the door.
