The phone rings.

Oh, no - how long have you been asleep? Sure, it was a tough night, but... This is bad. This is very bad.

Bedroom (in bed)
This bedroom is extremely spare, with dirty laundry scattered haphazardly all over the floor. Cleaner clothing can be found in the dresser. A bathroom lies to the south, while a door to the east leads to the living room.

On the end table are a telephone, a wallet and some keys.

The phone rings.

>
> answer phone

You pick up the phone. "Hadley!" a shrill voice cries. "Hadley, haven't you even left yet?? You knew that our presentation was at nine o'clock sharp! First the thing with the printers, now this - there won't even be enough left of you for Bowman to fire once he's done with you. Now get the hell down here!!"

Click.

It seems ridiculous to put on fresh, clean clothes when you yourself are covered with mud and dried sweat.

Bathroom
This is a far from luxurious but still quite functional bathroom, with a sink, toilet and shower. The bedroom lies to the north.

>

You don't think the watch you're wearing is waterproof.

You take off the gold watch.

Carrying your possessions into the shower is a bad idea.

clean clothing: Dropped.

You step into the shower, turn on the water, and within a few moments you feel like a new man. But no time to dawdle - you hop back out again and dry off in record time.

Living room
The furniture isn't as carefully arranged as one might like, and it's a bit lacking in the luxuries that might make this a more pleasant place to spend an evening - no stereo, no TV, no DVD, none of that - but this living room is still nicer than most of those in this neighborhood. A kitchenette lies to the east, the bedroom to the west and the front door to the south.

The front door is closed.

Driveway
This is quite a seedy neighborhood, but there isn't really anywhere in the whole Las Mesas metro area that isn't at least a little rundown. Of course, the locals may complain about the ugliness and the crime, but the fact is that a starter home like this one would cost easily five times as much in someplace like Las Playas - and that's if you could find one.

The house lies to the north. A car is parked here in the driveway.

>
> enter car

The car is locked.

>
> unlock car

Unlocked.

>
> enter car

You climb inside and start up the engine.

Driving
Ah, scenic Las Mesas. Man, this place is an absolute toilet. Soon you'll be able to afford to get the hell out of here - provided you can avoid making any more slip-ups on the job.

As you cruise down the road, you notice a freeway onramp approaching. Would you like to get on? >> 
> yes


You start to change lanes, but you notice that the ramp is out of service today - some sort of maintenance work. But that's okay - there's another onramp less than a mile down the road from here. You keep driving.

As you cruise down the road, you see the familiar Loungent Technologies building approaching. Would you like to stop here? >> 
> yes


You pull into the parking lot and hop out.

Loungent Technologies parking lot
You are at the employees' entrance to the Loungent Technologies building. There is a slot by the door, next to a sign reading "INSERT ID CARD HERE".

The car is parked in the parking lot.

>
> open wallet

You open the wallet, revealing a driver's license and an ID card.

>
> take id card

Taken.

>
> insert id card in slot

A green LED lights up, the door clicks open and you step inside.

Loungent Technologies
You are standing in a hallway near the back entrance to Loungent Technologies. The hallway leads north to the reception area and south to the parking lot, while a door marked "MATTHEW BOWMAN" lies to the west.

There is a cubicle here; it is marked simply "HADLEY".

>
> n

Given the circumstances, wandering around Loungent making small talk with the programmers might not be the brightest idea you've had today.

>
> enter cubicle

You get into the cubicle.

On the desk are a form, a pen and a note.

>
> read note

The note reads, "Hadley - sign this F209 and return it to me IMMEDIATELY!! MB".

>
> read form

This is a form numbered "F209". It is filled out, but not signed.

>
> take pen

Taken.

>
> sign form

Someone passes by the cubicle as you sign the form. You look up just in time to see Bowman's door click shut.

>
> take form

Taken.

>

You'll have to get out of the cubicle first.

>
> exit cubicle

You get out of the cubicle.

You walk into Bowman's office and, smiling, hand him the signed form.

Bowman asks, "Who the hell are you?"

The jig is up. You try to make a break for it, but Bowman calls for security and the guards wrestle you to the ground before you can make it back to the car.

The anchorman chuckles. "And now, on the lighter side of the news - you've heard about the burglar who broke into a home and started stealing the family's valuables, only to get so worn out from the exertion that he fell asleep and was caught when the homeowners returned? Here's one to top that: a burglar broke into an East Las Mesas home, killed the owner and stashed his body under the bed, put his possessions in the trunk of his car - and then fell asleep, woke up the next morning, went to his victim's office and tried to do the victim's job! An insanity defense is likely. And now here with the weather is Jay Doubleday - or is it?"

It's a brown leather wallet.

>
> open wallet

You open the wallet, revealing a driver's license and an ID card.

>
> examine id card

The size and shape of a credit card, this bears a magnetic strip on the back and some identification on the front:

BRIAN HADLEY
LOUNGENT TECHNOLOGIES
215 COLLINS STREET
LAS MESAS, DO 88701

>
> examine driver's license

BRIAN HADLEY
315 AVENIDA VICTORIA
EAST LAS MESAS, DO 88827

Driver's license photos are generally far from flattering, and this one is no exception, but this photo looks a lot better than you look now.
