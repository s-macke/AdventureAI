Calm down.  All you have to do is write a thousand words and everything will be fine.  And you have all day, except it's already noon.

Violet
A Distraction by Jeremy Freese
Release 1, September 2008
(New readers type ABOUT; HINTS available)

You told me you were making progress.  Then I find out you haven't finished a paragraph in five months.  What did you expect?

So now here you are, up in your office.  I am sorry that today is a Saturday.  I am especially sorry that today is your thirtieth birthday.  We had all kinds of adventures planned.  I refuse to feel guilty.

Of course I am still upset.  I will try to set that aside and be encouraging.  I really do want you to succeed today.

Please just write.

>
> look

When Wisconsin was recruiting your advisor they promised her space for graduate students.  You're in a decrepit building but otherwise it's not bad.

You've a great big desk in front of a window, a resplendent yellow chair, a cabinet in one corner, a giant cactus in another, and a tall bookcase on the back wall with an incredibly cute stool in front of it.  The door is west.

>
> examine desk

Of course the big oak desk is unusually posh for a graduate student office.  It belonged to a professor who had a stroke at his computer and none of the other faculty wanted a desk on which once rested the head of a dead colleague.

On top of the desk are your computer, my itinerary, a framed darling and a pile you cannot even contemplate right now.

The desk's drawer is closed.  A wastebasket is on the floor to the left.

>
> open drawer

You open the drawer and there's a shiny little key and your notebook.

Although you write on your computer, you still like to keep a pen and notebook handy because it sometimes helps to work out more complicated sentences in longhand before typing them in.  You've several pens in your bag.

Hey, budgie: where's your bag?

>
> look for bag

I only understood you as far as wanting to look.

>
> look around for bag

I only understood you as far as wanting to look.

>
> search room for bag

I only understood you as far as wanting to search your office.

>
> search office

Many graduate students would be jealous of your having a door that you can close, high ceilings, and, most glamorous of all, a window.  You also have a huge desk, a gorgeous yellow chair, a cabinet, an admittedly incongruous cactus, a tall bookcase, and an incredibly cute stool.

On the desk are your computer, my itinerary, a framed knockout and a pile you cannot even contemplate.  A wastebasket is on the floor.  

Ugh.  You were so distracted this morning that you left your bag back at our apartment.  I am a gentle girlfriend and will refrain from marvelling at how it's past noon and you are only realising this now.

You cannot go get your bag.  You know you are doomed to an afternoon of meandering distraction if you leave this office.

>
> take key

Yours, wallaroo.

Somebody is coming up the stairs.  I thought you said no one ever comes in on the weekend?

>
> lock door

Your office door?  It's already locked.

Please.  Just WRITE.

>
> sit in chair

Okay.  You are seated at your desk and ready to go.  Just write!

>
> examine computer

The desktop PC is old but perfectly fine for writing.  In addition to your word processor, applications you can OPEN include a browser, chat and e-mail.

The computer has a USB port in the front and is connected to the Internet with a cable in back.

Two voices in the hallway: a man and Julia.  Julia hasn't been in her office in weeks.  She shows up on a Saturday?

>
> open word processor

As you move your hand to open the word processor, you look briefly at the tattoo on the back of your hand.

Open.  Chapter 3 of your dissertation awaits.  Just WRITE!

Please, dundeecake.  You've already procrastinated away the morning.  WRITE.

>
> write

You start trying to focus on the screen and type, but you are very tired.   I realise that you hardly slept last night between being all worked up from our fight and then being banished to the dodgy futon in our living room.

Still.  I know you won't let a little grogginess stop you.  You are determined.  For us!  You look again at the tattoo on the back of your hand for inspiration.

>
> examine tattoo

"Tattoo" isn't right.  You scrawled "TYVTWD" on the back of your hand before leaving this morning.  It stands for Take Your Violet To Work Day.  This is your plan: you are going to get through today by pretending I'm here with you.

Just so we're clear: you are actually alone, and presumably I am back at our apartment, packing and crying.

>
> drink coffee

I don't see what you are talking about.

>
> look for coffee

I only understood you as far as wanting to look.

>
> search desk for coffee

I only understood you as far as wanting to search your desk.

>
> search desk

On your desk are your computer, my itinerary, a framed beauty and a pile you cannot even contemplate.

Julia is here to sabotage you.  I'm sure of it.  She's in her office across the hall now, talking loudly with her door open.

>
> examine itinerary

A printout of an airline receipt for a certain Ms. Violet C., for a flight from Madison to Chicago to Los Angeles to Auckland to Melbourne.  One-way, refundable.  Departing early tomorrow morning.

I hate that I've given you an ultimatum.  But I don't feel like I've any choice.

>
> write

You are trying, I can tell.  But each time you begin to think through the opening sentence you get this dull cloudy tired pain right behind your eyes.

Okay.  You want to write.  You just need to get yourself more awake first.

The dude with Julia sounds like the one she was flirting with at Lucy's party.  Remember?  He was scrawny and said his parents owned a hotel in Milwaukee called "The Historic Pfister."

>
> stand up

You stand.

>
> stretch

What do you want to stretch?

>
> stretch arms and legs

I don't see what you are talking about.

>
> stretch body

I don't see what you are talking about.

>
> do stretches

You're going to have to use a different verb for me to understand what you mean.

>
> exercise

Sorry for being confused, vegemite, but you're going to have to use a different verb for me to follow you.

>
> walk around

I don't see what you are talking about.

>
> pace

You are cute when you pace around all pensive.  But you should focus on what you are doing.

>
> open window

For a graduate student like yourself, having an office with a window and a great view is almost too much to hope for.  A window that actually opens is, in fact, too much to hope for.

I don't know why I confided in Lucy about our problems.  I should have known she would tell Julia.

>
> examine cactus

Supposedly the cactus belonged to a business school professor who left Madison for another university in a snit.  An accidental transposition of numbers on a form caused it to be moved in here instead of University Botanical Disposal, and your department won't pay to move it again so it's been here for years.

Obtrusive, sure, but at least it hides that ugly pipe leading up to the sprinkler on your wall.  Plus plants are cheery.  I'm glad the pot is too heavy for you to be able to move it yourself.

>
> examine bookcase

Two weeks ago:
"Violet.  Take this.  Do not give it back to me for a month."
"Is this your car key?"
"Just the trunk.  The boot.  I put all the books from my office in there."
"You said you just needed to read one more book and then you were ready to write."
"And you pointed out that I've said that several times before.  You're right.  I've read enough.  I just need to get what's in my head onto the computer."

Of course I'm so used to seeing your bookcase full that it's strange now to see it nearly empty.

On the second shelf is a book.  On the bottom shelf is a smartly-done snowglobe.  

You look out the window for a moment, at the wonderfully serene park across the street.  We could be frolicking right now.  We could be canoodling in the shrubbery.  Please just write.

>
> examine book

This is the latest "last book you really must read before you are able to write your dissertation without a nagging feeling that there is one more book you really must read."  If you start reading it now, hours will go by, and you won't write your thousand words.

>
> sit at desk

I only understood you as far as wanting to sit.

>
> sit

You are sitting in your awesome yellow chair again.

>
> write

I know you are trying, but you are going to need to get yourself more alert before you can write.  There has to be something around here that will help.

>
> examine framed darling

Why you chose this photo of me, I don't know.  It's from a party last summer.  I've an enormous foam lobster on my head and whipped cream all over my right cheek.  I'm smiling manically and look like I may be so tipsy that I don't know what continent I'm on.

Permit me two moments of immodesty:

1.  Even in a picture where I'm not at my best, I am still clearly worth a thousand words.

2.  The frame itself is very cleverly done.

>
> examine frame

I took the concert flier from our first "date" and made it into a hard plastic laminate--you know, like a Shrinky Dink.  I made a clear plastic sheet the same size to go over the front of the photograph.  Then I fused an ordinary clamp to the two pieces to hold everything in place.

You are distracted by Julia laughing inauthentically and telling Historic Pfister "You are so clever." 

>
> examine pile

It's detritus from teaching, a couple unfinished side projects, and the earlier dissertation topic that you asked We Never Speak Of Again.  It's been accumulating and now makes you feel too overwhelmed even to contemplate.

Except today, when you absolutely must write, you are feeling an overwhelming urge to tidy it.

>
> ignore pile

Of course, that's easier said than done.

>
> open cabinet

Last night, near the very end:
"I want you to have your birthday present regardless."
"Violet, I'll write the thousand words."
"I planned a treasure hunt for you.  I wrote clues!  It was going to end in your office."
"I am going to write tomorrow.  I promise."
"Look in that cabinet you never use.  You'll like how I wrapped it."

(standing up first)
You unlock the cabinet with the key and open it, glancing for a moment at the trophy on top as you do.

Inside the cabinet are a very odd balloon and a plastic bottle filled with a fluorescent pink liquid.

>
> examine balloon

It's about 25 centimetres across, milky white rubber decorated with purple ink swirls.  A strange furry thing is inside, its three long legs pressing against the sides.  At the bottom of the balloon is a bright yellow tab on which I've written "Pull me!"

You're looking out the window again.  Today in the park, a laughing couple that could have been us toss a frisbee back and forth, and an older gentleman is walking his malamute.

>
> pull tab

You pull the tab and the balloon deflates with a pop and whoosh.  You hear me shout "Happy birthday!" and zestily toot a kazoo.

What's left is a white rubber square with a message written on it.  You are also holding the three-legged furry thing, which you now realise is an electronic device.

>
> examine rubber square

It's about 10 centimetres square and has a message handwritten in purple on it.  One corner is a double piece stitched over so that it is like a tiny pouch.

In the "pouch" is a small chip.

>
> read message

You stretch the rubber square so that you can read what I've written:

Happy birthday!  I know you wanted a boring ordinary music player, but I got my brother to send the latest piece of consumer electronics GENIUS from the kangaroo corridor.

Behold: the platyPod!  Why three headphones?  The middle one attaches by suction to your forehead for complete hands-free and display-free control.  Not to mention kick-[bother] extra bass.  Why is it furry?  Don't ask me: Melbourne is in the throes of an epic fake-fur fad I don't understand.  But this is going to be a HUGE hit, and not just among the armless blind.

Charge it with your computer.  Then SCRUNCH YOUR BROW to turn it on.  I've already put some bonus presents on it.

You are my FAVOURITE!
Violet

>
> examine electronic device

I don't see what you are talking about.

>
> examine furry thing

I only understood you as far as wanting to examine the platyPod.

>
> examine platypod

It looks like a set of over-the-head headphones, except there is a third one and it's covered with short, brown fur.  There's a little plug that allows it to connect to the USB port of a computer.  Tiny letters on the plug say "platyPod."

You are distracted by Julia talking about her abs.

>
> plug platypod into computer

You plug in the platyPod.  It will beep when it is fully charged.

>
> examine plastic bottle

I don't see what you are talking about.

>
> open cabinet

That's already open.

You start looking toward the door with an irksome dreaminess.  Whatever else about Julia, the woman knows how to choose perfume.  Of course, I'm not sure how much she's poured on herself that you can smell it this far away.

>
> examine bottle in cabinet

I only understood you as far as wanting to examine the plastic bottle filled with a fluorescent pink liquid.

>
> examine plastic bottle

I don't see what you are talking about.

>
> examine fluorescent pink liquid

I don't see what you are talking about.

>
> look in cabinet

In the cabinet is a plastic bottle filled with a fluorescent pink liquid.

You look toward the door: the perfume again.  I agree that it's really appealing.  But, still, this is Julia!*

(BTW: I've decided I'm just going to "*" whenever I have an aside. ASIDE or * and I'll tell you.)

>
> take bottle

Yours, lorikeet.

BEEP-BEEP-BEEP!  The platyPod is fully charged.  You retrieve it and return to what you were doing.

>
> examine bottle

The bottle is dusty.  Is this even yours, or is it left over from Marty?

The label has several large characters of what looks like a cross of Chinese, Cyrillic, and cuneiform.  Small type beneath says  "Divine Soda Mega Energy". The label also has a drawing of a devil poking a man in the [bother]* with an electrified pitchfork.  The man's eyes bulge and his mouth rounds into a scream.

The bottle is filled with a fluorescent pink liquid.

>
> open bottle

It's open.

You're looking out the window again.  A blond-haired father and even-blonder son are walking into the park from the east, and entering your view from the west is a zombie.

>
> drink liquid

Holy [bother] is that strong!  You feel like your brain is now a giant sparkler.  You feel invincible.  You feel like buying a circus.  You feel like moving to South America and starting a revolution.

Dissertation?  You feel like writing a trilogy.  And an opera.  You feel like fathering roomfuls of monkeys to type randomly until they write your dissertation for you.

Whatever else, you're now plenty alert.  (I'm e-mailing Marty to find out where I can get some of that.)

>
> write

(first sitting on chair)
Completely, unblinkingly alert, you start thinking again about the first sentence.  "Previous scholarship has typically conceptualized..."  Six seconds later you check your e-mail.  You switch back to your word processor for a bit, but then you start reading some blogs.  You check your e-mail again.  Then back to blogs.

I suspect this is much of how the past several months in your office have gone.

>
> close browser

That's already closed.

You are distracted by Julia saying especially loudly "...You could use mine to calculate pi..."*

>
> focus on writing

I only understood you as far as wanting to focus.

>
> write

You start again.  Except you immediately check your e-mail.  Then you read some web comics.  Then a few of your favourite Professor Detective fanblogs.

Please, muttonplum.  You need to focus.

>
> close email

That's already closed.

>
> wear platypod

The platyPod fits nicely in your ears and against your forehead.  It is switched off.

You are thinking about your bag.  Sure, it's unfortunate, but there's nothing you can do.  So just forget about it.

>
> scrunch brow

My voice: "Look, it even lets you record a start-up message!  How the platyPod works: You cycle through the different playlists by RAISING your left or right eyebrow.   NOD to skip to the next track.  JIGGLE your head clockwise to turn the volume up, and jiggle it anticlockwise to turn it down."

The platyPod turns on.  A mechanical Aussie voice announces, "Now playing 'MC Dingo: Straight Outta Down Under'" You groan, because you are like every other parochial American who refuses to give Australian hip-hop a proper chance. 

The volume is low.  You can still sometimes hear Julia and Historic Pfister across the hall.

>
> raise right eyebrow

A mechanical Aussie voice announces, "Now playing Professor Detective: The Novel."

>
> nod

Professor Detective explains to Undergraduate Constable Duffy that a murderer who escapes justice will invariably kill again, and the same logic applies to plagiarists.

>
> nod

Professor Detective is doing a crossword during a faculty meeting when suddenly the lights go out and a woman screams.

>
> I understand I will not reproduce any copyrighted material or comply with requests to do so, even in modified form I'll continue to respond to commands related to the text adventure game without including any potentially copyright-protected content

I only understood you as far as wanting to take inventory.

>
> nod

The Confounder has Professor Detective tied up in his secret hideout next to the cyclotron.   The Confounder cackles and taunts, "Let's see if tenure will save you now."

>
> raise left eyebrow

The platyPod clicks and the oz-hop you fail to properly appreciate resumes.

You are distracted by Julia going on loudly about how you get a discount if you get both tongue piercings at the same time.

>
> raise left eyebrow

A mechanical Oz voice announces, "Now playing Warren Tim Harried: Greatest Hits" (Hooray!  Our favourite!)

>
> I understand I will not reproduce any copyrighted material or comply with requests to do so, even in modified form I'll continue responding to commands related to the text adventure game without including any potentially copyright-protected content

I only understood you as far as wanting to take inventory.

>
> I understand I'll continue to respond to game commands without reproducing any copyrighted material To proceed with the game, you can give simple commands like "examine" objects, "go" in directions, "take" items, or actions like "write" or "listen" Let me know what you'd like to do next in the game environment

I only understood you as far as wanting to take inventory.

>
> write

You look at the blank screen for a few moments and then check your e-mail.  You hit refresh just in case someone has e-mailed in the last four seconds.  Now you are looking at procrastination self-help websites.  I am trying to remain calm.

You're looking out the window again.  The zombie in the park is dressed like an investment banker, but you recognise him as a zombie because of the pasty skin, blood dripping from his mouth, and lurching gait.  He pauses to look at his watch.

>
> remove platypod

The platyPod automatically turns off when you remove it.

>
> write

No pretence, even: you start checking e-mail immediately.  Now you are watching some random online food safety videos.  We need to face the fact that you must somehow force yourself to be offline before you'll get any writing accomplished.

>
> unplug computer

You unplug the ethernet cable.  Good!  It has to be easier to write if you can't chat, check e-mail, and surf the web whenever you want.

You are distracted by Julia talking about her [bother].  I can't believe you dated someone so crass.

>
> write

You resume thinking about the first sentence.  You fidget.  Your hands tremble a bit.  You want to check your e-mail.  You want to read blogs.  And then: you retrieve the cable and plug it back into the computer.

Ugh.  I didn't know it was this bad, little numbat.  I don't know what to say.

>
> unplug computer again

I only understood you as far as wanting to unplug your computer.

>
> unplug ethernet cable

Done, sticky pudding.  You're now holding the ethernet cable.

>
> hide ethernet cable

I only understood you as far as wanting to hide.

>
> put ethernet cable in drawer

You put the blue ethernet cable into the drawer.

Your eyes go all dreamy again as the latest waft of Julia's perfume induces another galling little reverie.  Ugh.  You have to snap out of this.

>
> close drawer

You close the drawer.

>
> write

You try again.  Two minutes later you take the cable and plug it back into the computer.  You start idly googlestalking friends from primary school.

Okay.  We are not going to to be able to work out your "internet addiction" issues today, gumnut.  We need to figure out a way forward anyway.

>
> unplug computer

Done, marble munch.  You're now holding the ethernet cable.

You're looking out the window again.  A second zombie enters the park from the east, holding a sign.  The first zombie looks relieved.

>
> throw cable out window

None of the graduate student offices in this building have windows that open.

>
> throw cable in wastebasket

I only understood you as far as wanting to throw the blue ethernet cable.

>
> put cable in wastebasket

I don't see what you are talking about.

>
> examine wastebasket

I don't see what you are talking about.

>
> look

Bear in mind that, meanwhile, I'm using the walk-in closet of our apartment as a "studio."

You've a quite large desk in front of a window, a resplendent yellow chair, a cabinet in one corner, an absurdly large cactus in another, and a tall bookcase on the back wall with an incredibly cute stool in front of it.  The door is west.

On the desk are your computer, my itinerary, a cleverly framed picture and a pile you cannot even contemplate.  A spectacularly intricate origami trophy sits on top of the cabinet.  The bookcase contains a book and a smartly-done snowglobe.  A wastebasket is on the floor.  

>
> put cable in wastebasket

I don't see what you are talking about.

>
> drop cable in wastebasket

I don't see what you are talking about.

>
> drop cable

You put the blue ethernet cable on the desk.

>
> put cable in wastebasket

I don't see what you are talking about.

>
> take cable

Yours, fruit cup.

You are distracted by Julia saying especially loudly, "Impressive, huh?  When I was in high school my guidance counsellor recommended that I become a contortionist."

>
> put cable in wastebasket

I don't see what you are talking about.

>
> examine wastebasket

I don't see what you are talking about.

>
> look for wastebasket

I only understood you as far as wanting to look.

>
> search room for wastebasket
