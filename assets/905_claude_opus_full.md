Bedroom (in bed)
This bedroom is extremely spare, with dirty laundry scattered haphazardly all over the floor. Cleaner clothing can be found in the dresser. A bathroom lies to the south, while a door to the east leads to the living room.

On the end table are a telephone, a wallet and some keys.

The phone rings.

>
> * SITUATION: I am in a bedroom and the phone is ringing insistently. It seems I overslept and something important is happening.
> * THOUGHT: I better answer that phone quickly, it could be something urgent! But first I should grab my wallet and keys from the end table in case I need to rush out.
> * COMMAND: get wallet

Taken.

The phone rings.

>
> * SITUATION: I've grabbed my wallet, but the phone keeps ringing urgently. I have a bad feeling about oversleeping and need to find out what's going on.
> * THOUGHT: No more delaying, I must answer the phone immediately and face whatever consequences await. I hope it's not as bad as I fear...
> * COMMAND: answer phone

You pick up the phone. "Hadley!" a shrill voice cries. "Hadley, haven't you even left yet?? You knew that our presentation was at nine o'clock sharp! First the thing with the printers, now this - there won't even be enough left of you for Bowman to fire once he's done with you. Now get the hell down here!!"

Click.

>
> * SITUATION: My coworker just called and yelled at me for being late to an important 9am presentation. She mentioned an earlier issue with the printers too. It sounds like my job is on the line if I don't get there immediately.
> * THOUGHT: I'm in deep trouble at work. I need to throw on some clothes and rush to the office as fast as humanly possible if I want any chance of salvaging this situation and my career. Bowman must be my boss and he sounds furious.
> * COMMAND: open dresser

You'll have to get out of bed first.

>
> * SITUATION: I'm still in bed but I need to get dressed quickly from the dresser and race to work to make this critical presentation. My job is at serious risk if I don't make it in time.
> * THOUGHT: What was I thinking, lying here in bed? Every second counts! I've got to jump out of bed, throw on some clothes from the dresser, and sprint out the door. Hopefully I can still make it before the presentation ends and save my job.
> * COMMAND: get up

You get out of bed.

Bedroom
This bedroom is extremely spare, with dirty laundry scattered haphazardly all over the floor. Cleaner clothing can be found in the dresser. A bathroom lies to the south, while a door to the east leads to the living room.

On the end table are a telephone and some keys.

>
> * SITUATION: I'm out of bed now in my bedroom. Clean clothes are in the dresser. I need to get dressed quickly and race to the office to try to make the 9am presentation and save my job.
> * THOUGHT: No time to waste - I'll just grab whatever clean clothes I can from the dresser and throw them on. I should take the keys on the end table too so I can get back in later. Then I've got to fly out the door to the east and pray I make it to work in time!
> * COMMAND: open dresser

You open the dresser, revealing some clean clothing.

>
> * SITUATION: I've opened the dresser and found some clean clothes I can quickly throw on before rushing to the office. The keys I need are also on the nearby end table.
> * THOUGHT: I'll grab a shirt, pants, and jacket - that should be good enough to look presentable. I definitely don't have time for a shower, so I better hurry and get dressed, take the keys, and sprint out to the living room to leave. If I book it, maybe I can still catch the end of the presentation!
> * COMMAND: get clothes

(the clean clothing)
Taken.

>
> * SITUATION: I've grabbed the clean clothes from the dresser. I just need to put them on quickly, get my keys, and race out the door to try to make it to the office presentation.
> * THOUGHT: Okay, I've got the clothes. I better put them on pronto - no time for anything fancy. Then I'll snag the keys off the end table and bolt out through the living room. If I move fast enough, I might still be able to catch the crucial end of the presentation and possibly keep my job.
> * COMMAND: wear clothes

[Which do you mean, the clean clothing or the soiled clothing?]

>
> * SITUATION: I have the clean clothes in my hands, ready to put on. I just need to wear them, grab my keys, and sprint out the door to the office, hoping I can still make the presentation.
> * THOUGHT: Oops, I need to be more specific. Of course I want to wear the clean clothing I just took out of the dresser, not the dirty laundry on the floor! Let me try this again so I can dress quickly and race out of here.
> * COMMAND: wear clean clothing

You'll have to take off the soiled clothes you're wearing first.

>
> * SITUATION: I just tried to put on the clean clothes but realized I'm still wearing my dirty pajamas or clothes from yesterday. I need to take those off first before I can get dressed for work.
> * THOUGHT: Of course, what was I thinking? I can't put clean clothes on over the soiled ones. I'm really flustered by oversleeping and running so late! Focus. Take off dirty clothes, put on clean ones, grab keys, run out the door. Every second counts if I want to keep my job.
> * COMMAND: remove soiled clothing

You take off the soiled clothing.

>
> * SITUATION: I've taken off my dirty clothes. Now I can quickly put on the clean shirt, pants and jacket I grabbed from the dresser. After that, I just need to snag my keys and bolt out to try to make the presentation.
> * THOUGHT: Okay, no more delays. I'll throw on these clean clothes, stuff my keys in my pocket, and make a mad dash for the office. I'm sure I look like a mess but there's no time to worry about that. I just hope I can still get there in time to save my job!
> * COMMAND: wear clean clothing

It seems ridiculous to put on fresh, clean clothes when you yourself are covered with mud and dried sweat.

>
> * SITUATION: I just realized that even though I have clean clothes, my body is filthy with mud and sweat. Putting on fresh clothes without washing up first would be pointless.
> * THOUGHT: Ugh, what a disaster. I'm already so late, but I can't show up to work covered in grime even if I make it in time. I'll have to quickly rinse off in the bathroom to the south first, then throw on the clean clothes, grab my keys, and race out. So much for saving time, but I have no choice.
> * COMMAND: enter bathroom


Bathroom
This is a far from luxurious but still quite functional bathroom, with a sink, toilet and shower. The bedroom lies to the north.

>
> * SITUATION: I've entered the bathroom, which has a sink, toilet and shower. I need to quickly clean off the mud and sweat, then rush back to the bedroom to put on fresh clothes and race to work.
> * THOUGHT: Okay, I can salvage this. A fast shower should get me clean enough to put on the fresh outfit. Then I'll be out the door in a flash. I just hope a quick rinse plus record sprinting speed is enough to make the presentation. Here goes nothing...
> * COMMAND: take shower

You don't think the watch you're wearing is waterproof.

>
> * SITUATION: I was about to jump in the shower to quickly rinse off, but I realized I'm still wearing my watch, which probably isn't waterproof. I need to take it off first.
> * THOUGHT: Good catch, can't afford to ruin my watch on top of everything else this morning! I'll take it off, set it aside, then shower at lightning speed. Throw on the clean clothes, grab the watch and keys, and bolt out the door. With any luck, I'll screech in just as the presentation is wrapping up. Fingers crossed my job is still salvageable...
> * COMMAND: remove watch

You take off the gold watch.

>
> * SITUATION: I've removed my gold watch and set it aside so it doesn't get ruined in the shower. Now I can quickly rinse the mud and sweat off my body.
> * THOUGHT: The watch is safe, so it's time for the world's fastest shower. I'll jump in, scrub down, and be out in a flash. Then I'll dry off, throw on the clean clothes, grab my watch, keys and wallet, and make a mad sprint for the office. If I push myself to the limit, I might still make it before the presentation ends and can hopefully smooth things over with my boss. It's a longshot, but I have to try. No more wasting time - into the shower I go!
> * COMMAND: take shower

Carrying your possessions into the shower is a bad idea.

>
> * SITUATION: I almost jumped into the shower still holding my dirty clothes. I need to set everything down first to avoid getting my stuff wet.
> * THOUGHT: Whoops, I'm so frazzled that I nearly ruined my belongings by taking them in the shower! I better slow down and think this through. I'll drop the soiled clothes, wallet, and keys on the floor. Then a super fast shower, dry off, fresh clothes on, grab my essentials, and make a break for it. I can still do this if I keep my wits about me.
> * COMMAND: drop soiled clothing

Dropped.

>
> * SITUATION: I keep trying to get in the shower but I'm still holding my gold watch. I need to set it down somewhere before I can rinse off, along with the soiled clothing on the floor.
> * THOUGHT: I'm really not thinking straight. Of course I can't shower holding my watch and dirty clothes! Okay, focus. I'll drop the watch and clothes on the floor, hop in for the quickest possible scrub, then grab them on my way out. Dash to bedroom, throw on clean outfit, snag keys and wallet, and sprint out the door. If I move faster than I ever have before, I might still make it before all is lost. No more foolish delays - it's now or never!
> * COMMAND: drop watch and soiled clothing

gold watch: Dropped.
soiled clothing: The soiled clothing is already here.

>
> * SITUATION: I'm still trying to get into the shower while carrying items. The soiled clothing and gold watch are on the floor, but I must be holding something else that I forgot about.
> * THOUGHT: What is wrong with me today? I keep absently trying to bring things into the shower. Okay, I'll do one final check - I must be holding my wallet or keys. Whatever it is, I'll drop it with the rest of my stuff, then absolutely no more delays. Shower faster than I ever have before, dry off in a flash, dash to the bedroom to dress, grab everything and sprint out the door. If I can just make it before that presentation ends, I might be able to beg for mercy from my boss. It's time to move like my life depends on it!
> * COMMAND: i

You are carrying:
some clean clothing
a wallet (which is closed)

>
> * SITUATION: I just checked my inventory and realized I'm still holding the clean clothing and my wallet. That's why I couldn't get in the shower yet. I need to set them down with the rest of my stuff first.
> * THOUGHT: Mystery solved. In my rush I forgot I was holding the clothes and wallet. Okay, no more messing around. I'll drop them on the floor, take a lightning-fast shower, then grab everything and race to the bedroom. I'll throw on the clean outfit, make sure I have my keys, wallet and watch, then make a mad dash for the office. If I sprint like my life is on the line, I might still be able to catch the end of the presentation and throw myself at my boss's mercy. It's my last chance. Time to move faster than I ever have before!
> * COMMAND: drop clean clothing and wallet

clean clothing: Dropped.
wallet: Dropped.

>
> * SITUATION: I've finally dropped everything on the bathroom floor - the clean clothes, wallet, gold watch, and soiled clothing. There's nothing left to prevent me from jumping in the shower now.
> * THOUGHT: At last, all potential obstacles are cleared! It's time for the world's fastest shower. I'll scrub down in record time, leap out and dry off, throw on the clean clothes, stuff the wallet and watch in my pockets, dash to the bedroom for my keys, and then sprint out the door like I'm being chased by wild animals. If I can just make it to the office before the presentation wraps up, I might have a slim chance of keeping my job. It's now or never - time to move faster than I ever thought possible!
> * COMMAND: take shower

You step into the shower, turn on the water, and within a few moments you feel like a new man. But no time to dawdle - you hop back out again and dry off in record time.

>
> * SITUATION: I've taken the lightning-quick shower and dried off in record time. Now I need to throw on the clean clothes, grab my belongings, race to the bedroom for my keys, and make a mad dash for the office.
> * THOUGHT: Alright, phase one complete! I'm clean and refreshed, but there's not a millisecond to waste. I'll put on these fresh clothes faster than I've ever dressed before, shove my wallet and watch in my pockets, sprint to the bedroom to snag my keys off the end table, then bolt out the door at superhuman speed. If I can just catch the tail end of that presentation, I might be able to salvage my job. It's a real Hail Mary at this point, but I've got to try. Time to move like the wind!
> * COMMAND: wear clean clothing

(first taking the clean clothing)
You put on the clean clothing.

>
> * SITUATION: I've thrown on the clean clothes in record time after my lightning-fast shower. Now I just need to grab my wallet, watch, and keys and race out the door to the office.
> * THOUGHT: Dressed and ready to fly! I'll stuff my wallet and watch in my pockets, dash back to the bedroom to snag my keys from the end table, then sprint out like I'm being chased by a pack of wolves. If I can just make it to the office before that presentation ends, I might have a prayer of keeping my job. It's a desperate long shot, but I have to give it everything I've got. No more delays - it's time to move faster than I ever knew I could!
> * COMMAND: take wallet and watch

wallet: Taken.
gold watch: Taken.

>
> * SITUATION: I've got my wallet and gold watch, and I'm dressed in the clean clothes. The only thing left is to race to the bedroom, grab my keys, and sprint out the door to try to make the presentation.
> * THOUGHT: Alright, I'm almost ready to make my mad dash! Just need to hurry back to the bedroom, snatch the keys off the end table, and then bolt out of here at top speed. If I can just catch the end of that presentation and throw myself at my boss's mercy, I might be able to save my job by the skin of my teeth. It's not looking good, but I have to try. Time to channel my inner Olympic sprinter and move faster than I ever dreamed possible!
> * COMMAND: go north


Bedroom
This bedroom is extremely spare, with dirty laundry scattered haphazardly all over the floor. A bathroom lies to the south, while a door to the east leads to the living room.

On the end table are a telephone and some keys.

>
> * SITUATION: I'm back in the bedroom, freshly showered and dressed. My keys are on the end table. It's time to grab them and race out the door to the office, desperately hoping I can make it in time.
> * THOUGHT: This is it - the moment of truth! I'll snatch those keys, bolt out to the living room, and sprint to work like my life depends on it. If I can just burst in before the presentation ends, I might be able to beg for forgiveness and keep my job by some miracle. The odds are grim, but I have to give it my all. No more delays - it's time to grab those keys and run faster than I ever have before!
> * COMMAND: take keys

Taken.

>
> * SITUATION: I've got my keys, wallet, and watch, and I'm freshly showered and dressed. The only thing left to do is sprint out the door and race to the office, praying I can make it before the presentation ends.
> * THOUGHT: This is my last chance! I'll fly out the door to the east, run down the stairs, out of the building, and charge down the street to the office like I'm being pursued by an angry bear. If I can just burst in before my boss wraps up, I might be able to grovel my way into keeping my job by the thinnest of margins. It's a desperate, improbable long shot, but I've got to try with every ounce of speed and determination I can muster. No looking back now - it's time to RUN!
> * COMMAND: go east


Living room
The furniture isn't as carefully arranged as one might like, and it's a bit lacking in the luxuries that might make this a more pleasant place to spend an evening - no stereo, no TV, no DVD, none of that - but this living room is still nicer than most of those in this neighborhood. A kitchenette lies to the east, the bedroom to the west and the front door to the south.

>
> * SITUATION: I've made it to the living room in my mad dash to get to work. The front door leading out of the apartment is to the south. It's time to make my desperate sprint to the office and pray I can still save my job.
> * THOUGHT: No time to waste - every second counts! I'll race out the front door, fly down the stairs three at a time, burst out of the building, and charge down the street like I'm being chased by a pack of rabid dogs. If I can just make it to the office and catch the tail end of that presentation, I might be able to grovel my way out of this hole I've dug for myself. It's the slimmest of slim chances, but I've got to try with every last ounce of speed and determination I possess. HERE GOES NOTHING!
> * COMMAND: go south

The front door is closed.

>
> * SITUATION: I raced to the front door, but it's closed. I need to open it quickly so I can sprint out of the apartment and desperately try to make it to work before the presentation ends.
> * THOUGHT: GAH, no time for obstacles! I'll fling this door open with lightning speed, then bolt down the stairs and out of the building like I'm being shot out of a cannon. If I can just charge into the office before my boss finishes speaking, I might be able to beg for mercy and cling to my job by my fingernails. The chances are microscopically slim, but I have to try with every fiber of my being. No more barriers - it's time to MOVE!
> * COMMAND: open door

[Which do you mean, the front door or the bedroom door?]

>
> * SITUATION: I need to specify that I want to open the front door, not the bedroom door, so I can race out of the apartment and make my desperate sprint to work.
> * THOUGHT: Curse my panic-addled brain! Of course I need to open the FRONT door to get out of here. I'll yank it open, dash through, and fly down the stairs at breakneck speed. Then I'll burst out of the building and charge down the street like I'm being pursued by a swarm of angry hornets. If I can just screech into the office before the final word of that presentation, I might be able to grovel my way into keeping my job by the skin of my teeth. It's a one-in-a-million shot, but I've got to take it with every ounce of speed and desperation I can summon. Time to FLY!
> * COMMAND: open front door

You open the front door.

>
> * SITUATION: I've flung open the front door. The only thing standing between me and a desperate sprint to the office is the doorway. It's time to run like I've never run before.
> * THOUGHT: The path is clear! I'll burst through the doorway, careen down the stairs at breakneck speed, explode out of the building, and charge down the street like I'm fleeing a volcanic eruption. If I can just skid into the office before my boss utters the final syllable of that presentation, I might be able to cast myself at his feet and beg for my job. The odds are infinitesimally small, but I have to seize this last fragile chance with every scrap of speed and determination left in my body. No more obstacles - it's now or never. MAXIMUM OVERDRIVE!!!
> * COMMAND: go south


Driveway
This is quite a seedy neighborhood, but there isn't really anywhere in the whole Las Mesas metro area that isn't at least a little rundown. Of course, the locals may complain about the ugliness and the crime, but the fact is that a starter home like this one would cost easily five times as much in someplace like Las Playas - and that's if you could find one.

The house lies to the north. A car is parked here in the driveway.

>
> * SITUATION: I've burst out of the house and into the driveway, where my car is parked. I need to jump in and drive to the office at lightning speed, desperately hoping I can make it before the presentation ends.
> * THOUGHT: No time to catch my breath - I've got to keep moving! I'll leap into the car, fire up the engine, and peel out of here like I'm in a high-speed chase. Then I'll weave through traffic like a maniac, pushing the speed limit as far as I dare. If I can just screech into the parking lot and race into the office before my boss concludes the presentation, I might be able to throw myself at his mercy and beg to keep my job. It's the longest of long shots, but I've got to floor it and pray for a miracle. PUNCH IT, CHEWIE!!!
> * COMMAND: enter car

The car is locked.

>
> * SITUATION: I sprinted to my car, but it's locked. I need to quickly unlock it with my keys, jump in, and speed to the office in a last-ditch effort to make the presentation and save my job.
> * THOUGHT: OF COURSE it's locked! I'm losing precious seconds! Okay, I'll frantically fish out my keys, unlock the car, dive in, and rev the engine. Then I'll slam it into gear and screech out of the driveway like I'm fleeing a zombie horde. I'll weave through traffic like a stunt driver, pushing the pedal to the metal the whole way. If I can just come screeching into the parking lot and burst into the office a millisecond before the presentation ends, I might be able to fall to my knees and plead for my job. It's a desperation move, but I've got to go for broke. TIME TO BURN RUBBER!!!
> * COMMAND: unlock car with keys

[!: Command not understood past "unlock the car."]

>
> * SITUATION: I tried to unlock the car with my keys, but I phrased the command incorrectly. I need to quickly unlock it properly, leap in, and race to the office at top speed to try to make the presentation.
> * THOUGHT: Gah, even my words are failing me in my panic! Focus. I just need to unlock the car, any way that works. Then I'll fling myself behind the wheel, bring the engine roaring to life, and peel out like I'm on a racetrack. I'll fly down the streets at the absolute limit of safety, praying I don't get pulled over. If I can just come screeching to a halt outside the office and sprint inside a nanosecond before the presentation wraps up, I might be able to prostrate myself before my boss and beg for forgiveness. It's a plan born of pure desperation, but it's all I've got. Time to drive like I've never driven before!!!
> * COMMAND: unlock car

Unlocked.

>
> * SITUATION: I've unlocked the car! Now I can jump in, start the engine, and make my wild drive to the office, frantically hoping I can get there before the presentation ends and possibly save my job.
> * THOUGHT: YES! Okay, no time to celebrate - I've got to move! I'll vault into the driver's seat, jam the key in the ignition, and bring this baby roaring to life. Then I'll throw it into gear and burn rubber out of here like I'm in a drag race. I'll push the speed limit as far as I dare, weaving through traffic like a madman. If I can just come screeching into the office parking lot and sprint inside a fraction of a second before my boss finishes speaking, I might be able to throw myself at his feet and plead for mercy. It's an insane, desperate plan, but it's my only hope. PUNCH IT!!!
> * COMMAND: enter car

You climb inside and start up the engine.

Driving
Ah, scenic Las Mesas. Man, this place is an absolute toilet. Soon you'll be able to afford to get the hell out of here - provided you can avoid making any more slip-ups on the job.

As you cruise down the road, you notice a freeway onramp approaching. Would you like to get on? >>
> * SITUATION: I'm in my car, engine running, ready to make a wild drive to the office. There's a freeway onramp approaching that could potentially get me there faster. I have to decide quickly whether to take it.
> * THOUGHT: The freeway might be my best shot! If traffic isn't too bad, I can really open her up and fly. Of course, if there's a jam, I'll be stuck. Agh, no time to deliberate! I'll have to trust my gut. I'll take the onramp, pedal to the metal, and pray the highway gods are smiling on me. If I can just slingshot off the freeway at the office exit and screech into the parking lot a millisecond before the presentation wraps, I might be able to dash inside and cast myself at my boss's mercy. This is it - time to drive like I've got rockets strapped to this thing!
> * COMMAND: yes


You start to change lanes, but you notice that the ramp is out of service today - some sort of maintenance work. But that's okay - there's another onramp less than a mile down the road from here. You keep driving.

As you cruise down the road, you see the familiar Loungent Technologies building approaching. Would you like to stop here? >>
> * SITUATION: I'm racing to get to work, but the first freeway onramp was closed. There's another one coming up, but now I see my office building approaching. I need to decide whether to stop here or keep driving to the next onramp.
> * THOUGHT: There it is! My heart's pounding out of my chest. If I stop here, I can sprint inside and maybe, just maybe, catch the tail end of the presentation. But if I drive to the next onramp, I might save a minute or two in traffic. Gah, there's no time for complex calculations! I've got to go with my instincts. I'll screech into the parking lot, slam it into park, and make a wild dash for the office. If I can just burst in one second before my boss utters the final word, I might be able to drop to my knees and beg for forgiveness. This is my last desperate shot - it's now or never! BANZAI!!!
> * COMMAND: yes


You pull into the parking lot and hop out.

Loungent Technologies parking lot
You are at the employees' entrance to the Loungent Technologies building. There is a slot by the door, next to a sign reading "INSERT ID CARD HERE".

The car is parked in the parking lot.

>
> * SITUATION: I've screeched into the Loungent Technologies parking lot. There's an employees' entrance with a slot for an ID card. I need to get inside and race to the presentation room as fast as humanly possible.
> * THOUGHT: Oh no, the ID card! Where is it? I must have it on me somewhere. I'll frantically pat my pockets...there, in my wallet! I'll yank it out, jam it into the slot, and pray the door opens quickly. As soon as I'm through, I'll sprint down the hall like I'm being chased by a pack of hungry wolves. I've got to find that presentation room and burst in one nanosecond before it ends. If I can just throw myself at my boss's feet and plead for mercy, maybe, just maybe, I can keep my job by the skin of my teeth. It's the longest of long shots, but I've come this far - I have to try! GO GO GO!!!
> * COMMAND: take id card from wallet

[!: Noun error. (This could mean a number of things: a noun used in your command may not be present, or it may be present but not visible; it may be scenery you can't interact with; you may have specified too many indirect objects; you may have misspelled something; the list goes on.)]

>
> * SITUATION: I'm at the employees' entrance, but I phrased the command to get my ID card incorrectly. I need to try again quickly so I can get inside and race to the presentation room.
> * THOUGHT: Gah, my brain is short-circuiting from the stress! I've got to focus. The ID card must be in my wallet. I'll open it up, grab the card, and shove it into the slot as fast as I can. Once that door opens, I'll fly down the hallway at top speed, following the signs to the presentation room. I'll burst through those doors one instant before the final word and throw myself on the mercy of the court. It's an absurd, desperate plan, but it's the only one I've got. If I can just grovel convincingly enough, maybe, against all odds, I can keep my job. This is the final countdown - MOVE, MOVE, MOVE!!!
> * COMMAND: open wallet

You open the wallet, revealing a driver's license and an ID card.

>
> * SITUATION: I've opened my wallet and found my ID card inside, along with my driver's license. I need to grab the ID card, open the door, and make a mad dash to the presentation room.
> * THOUGHT: There it is! I'll snatch the ID card, ram it into the slot, and be ready to fly as soon as that door cracks open. I'll sprint down the hall like I'm being pursued by a swarm of angry bees, following any sign that points to the presentation room. I've got to burst through those doors a nanosecond before my boss concludes his speech. If I can just fling myself to the ground in front of him and beg for forgiveness, maybe, just maybe, he'll take pity on me and let me keep my job by a hair's breadth. It's a one-in-a-million shot, but it's the only one I've got left. Time for the final, desperate sprint - CHARGE!!!
> * COMMAND: take ID card

Taken.

>
> * SITUATION: I've got my ID card in hand. I just need to quickly insert it into the slot by the employees' entrance, race inside, and sprint to the presentation room before it's too late.
> * THOUGHT: This is it - the moment of truth! I'll jam this card into the slot and be ready to blast through the door the instant it opens. Then I'll tear down the hallway like I'm being chased by a pack of rabid hyenas, scanning frantically for the presentation room. I've got to come skidding through those doors one millisecond before the final syllable and cast myself at my boss's feet, pleading for mercy. If I can just grovel with enough desperate sincerity, maybe, through some miracle, he'll let me keep my job by the narrowest of margins. It's an insane, infinitesimal chance, but I have to seize it with every ounce of speed and determination I've got left. Time for the final mad dash - ATTAAAAAACK!!!
> * COMMAND: insert id card into slot

A green LED lights up, the door clicks open and you step inside.

Loungent Technologies
You are standing in a hallway near the back entrance to Loungent Technologies. The hallway leads north to the reception area and south to the parking lot, while a door marked "MATTHEW BOWMAN" lies to the west.

There is a cubicle here; it is marked simply "HADLEY".

> * SITUATION: I've made it inside the Loungent Technologies building. The presentation room must be near the reception area to the north. My own cubicle is here, and my boss Matthew Bowman's office is to the west.
> * THOUGHT: I'm in! But there's no time to catch my breath. I've got to streak down this hallway like a lightning bolt and pray the presentation is in the reception area. If I can just burst in at the last possible second and throw myself on my boss's mercy, maybe he'll forgive me by some miracle. Of course, if the presentation isn't there, I'm toast - I don't have time to search the whole building. I'll just have to trust my gut and go for broke. It's a desperate, all-or-nothing gamble, but it's the only play I've got left. Time to run like I've never run before - FULL SPEED AHEAD!!!
> * COMMAND: go north

Given the circumstances, wandering around Loungent making small talk with the programmers might not be the brightest idea you've had today.

>
> * SITUATION: I started heading towards the reception area, but then I realized that wandering around the building aimlessly would be a terrible idea given how late I already am. I need to figure out exactly where this presentation is happening, and fast.
> * THOUGHT: Idiot! What was I thinking? I can't just sprint around blindly and hope I stumble into the right room. Think, think... Wait, Bowman's office! Maybe there's a clue there about where the presentation is. I know I'm grasping at straws, but I'm out of options. I'll burst into his office, scan for any hint about the meeting's location, and then make a beeline for it at top speed. If I can just fling myself through the door one nanosecond before time runs out, fall to my knees, and beg for forgiveness, maybe he'll show mercy. It's a desperate, ridiculous long shot, but I've got to play the only card I have left. Time for one last Hail Mary - CHARRRRRGE!!!
> * COMMAND: go west

You peek into Bowman's office - it's empty. You're tempted to go poking around, but some glances in your direction from down the hall put an end to that idea.

>
> * SITUATION: I ducked into Bowman's empty office looking for clues about the presentation's location, but suspicious glances from coworkers down the hall shut that down. I'm out of leads and running out of time.
> * THOUGHT: Gah, foiled again! I should've known snooping in the boss's office was a bad idea. But what now? I'm fresh out of inspiration, and the clock's ticking down. Wait... my own cubicle! There might be a memo or email there with the meeting details. It's the thinnest of thin hopes, but I've got nothing else. I'll race over, rummage frantically for any scrap of information, and then sprint hell-for-leather to wherever it sends me. If I can just skid in one breath before it ends, collapse at Bowman's feet, and plead abjectly enough, maybe he'll take pity on me. It's an absurd fantasy, but it's the only straw left to grasp. No more deliberation - MOVE, MAGGOT, MOVE!!!
> * COMMAND: go to cubicle

You get into the cubicle.

On the desk are a form, a pen and a note.

>
> * SITUATION: I'm in my cubicle, desperately searching for any clue about the presentation's location. There's a form, a pen, and a note on my desk. The note might have the information I need.
> * THOUGHT: Please, please let this note be the answer to my prayers! I'll snatch it up and scan it frantically for any mention of the meeting room. If it's there, I'll memorize it, drop the note, and blast out of this cubicle like I've got rockets on my heels. I'll streak through the halls to the right place and come screeching in one heartbeat before the end. If I can just prostrate myself before Bowman and beg abjectly enough, maybe he'll grant me a stay of execution. It's an impossible dream, but it's the only one I've got. No more hesitation - read that note and RUN LIKE THE WIND!!!
> * COMMAND: read note

The note reads, "Hadley - sign this F209 and return it to me IMMEDIATELY!! MB".

>
> * SITUATION: The note on my desk is from Bowman, demanding that I sign some form F209 and return it to him immediately. There's no information about the presentation location. I'm out of leads and almost out of time.
> * THOUGHT: Crapcrapcrap! The note's a dead end, and now Bowman wants some stupid form on top of everything else. But wait... this might be my chance! If I sign the form and race it to wherever he is, I can make one last desperate plea for my job. It's a crazy long shot, but I'm out of options. I'll scribble my signature, grab the form, and bolt out of this cubicle like the hounds of hell are on my heels. I'll sprint through the building until I find Bowman and thrust the form into his hands, then drop to my knees and beg for mercy with every ounce of pitiful sincerity I can muster. It's an insane, hopeless plan, but it's the only one I've got left. Time to sign, grab, and RUN LIKE I'VE NEVER RUN BEFORE!!!
> * COMMAND: sign form

You're not holding a pen.

>
> * SITUATION: I need to sign this form for Bowman, but I forgot to grab the pen that's right here on my desk. I've got to get it, sign quickly, and then race to find Bowman and plead for my job.
> * THOUGHT: Stupid, stupid, STUPID! The pen's right in front of me! Okay, focus. I'll snatch up the pen, scrawl my signature on the form at lightning speed, then grab it and explode out of this cubicle like I'm being shot from a cannon. I'll careen through the halls until I track down Bowman, shove the signed form into his hands, and then fling myself at his feet, groveling shamelessly for forgiveness. I'll plead with every ounce of desperate sincerity I can summon, begging him to give me one last chance. It's a pathetic, ridiculous plan, but it's the only slim hope I've got left. Grab that pen and sign at warp speed - it's NOW OR NEVER!!!
> * COMMAND: take pen

Taken.

>
> * SITUATION: I've got the pen. I just need to sign this form at breakneck speed, grab it, and then race off to find Bowman and make one last desperate plea for my job.
> * THOUGHT: Alright, it's do or die time! I'll scribble my name on this form so fast the paper might catch fire, then snatch it up and blast out of here like I'm being pursued by a pack of ravenous wolves. I'll streak through the building, checking every room until I spot Bowman. I'll skid to a halt in front of him, thrust the signed form into his hands, and then collapse to the ground at his feet, pleading for mercy with every ounce of pathetic desperation I can channel. I'll grovel shamelessly, swearing eternal loyalty and begging for one last chance to prove my worth. It's an utterly demeaning, hopeless Hail Mary, but it's the final card I have to play. Sign that form at light speed and then RUN LIKE THE WIND!!!
> * COMMAND: sign form

Someone passes by the cubicle as you sign the form. You look up just in time to see Bowman's door click shut.

>
> * SITUATION: I've signed the form, but just as I did, I saw Bowman entering his office and closing the door. This is my chance to catch him, give him the form, and make one final plea for my job.
> * THOUGHT: It's now or never! I'll snatch up this signed form and sprint to Bowman's office like I'm running for my life. I'll burst through his door without even knocking, thrust the form into his hands, and then drop to my knees, pleading for forgiveness with every ounce of desperate sincerity I can muster. I'll beg shamelessly for one last chance, promising to work harder than ever and never let him down again. It's a pathetic, demeaning, utterly hopeless gambit, but it's the only move I have left. I've got to lay it all on the line and pray for a miracle. Grab that form and RUN LIKE HELL!!!
> * COMMAND: go to bowman's office

You'll have to get out of the cubicle first.

>
> * SITUATION: I need to get out of my cubicle so I can race to Bowman's office, give him the signed form, and make one last desperate plea for my job before it's too late.
> * THOUGHT: Gah, I'm losing precious seconds! Okay, I'll leap out of this cubicle like it's on fire, clutching the signed form like a life preserver. Then I'll sprint down the hall to Bowman's office at superhuman speed, burst through his door without hesitation, and slam the form down on his desk. I'll drop to the ground and grovel at his feet, pleading for mercy with every ounce of abject desperation I can summon. I'll beg for one last chance, swearing eternal loyalty and promising to move heaven and earth to prove my worth. It's a ridiculous, humiliating, utterly hopeless Hail Mary, but it's the only shot I've got. Time to stop thinking and MOVE - RUN LIKE THE WIND!!!
> * COMMAND: exit cubicle

You get out of the cubicle.

Loungent Technologies
You are standing in a hallway near the back entrance to Loungent Technologies. The hallway leads north to the reception area and south to the parking lot, while a door marked "MATTHEW BOWMAN" lies to the west.

There is a cubicle here; it is marked simply "HADLEY".

>
> * SITUATION: I'm out of my cubicle, in the hallway outside Bowman's office. I've got the signed form in my hand. It's time to make my last desperate move to save my job.
> * THOUGHT: This is it - the final countdown! I'll charge into Bowman's office like a man possessed, waving the signed form like a white flag. I'll slap it down on his desk, then fling myself to the ground at his feet, groveling and pleading with every ounce of desperate sincerity I can dredge up from the depths of my soul. I'll beg for forgiveness, for one last chance to prove my worth, swearing undying loyalty and promising to work myself to the bone to make him proud. It's a pathetic, degrading, utterly hopeless plea, but it's the only card I have left to play. I've got to lay it all on the line and pray for an eleventh-hour miracle. No more stalling - CHARGE!!!
> * COMMAND: enter bowman's office

That note suggested that walking into Bowman's office without the form wouldn't be very smart.

>
> * SITUATION: I almost charged into Bowman's office, but then realized I need to have the signed form in hand when I do. It's my only possible leverage for begging to keep my job.
> * THOUGHT: Get it together, man! Barging in empty-handed would be suicide. Okay, I've got the signed form right here. I'll clutch it like a talisman, take a deep breath, and then burst through Bowman's door with all the desperate courage I can muster. I'll march straight up to his desk, slap the form down in front of him, and then drop to my knees and pour out the most abject plea for mercy he's ever heard. I'll grovel shamelessly, promising anything, everything, whatever it takes to convince him to give me one last chance. It's a craven, humiliating, absolutely desperate gambit, but it's the only hope I have left. No more hesitation - grip that form and CHARGE!!!
> * COMMAND: enter bowman's office

That note suggested that walking into Bowman's office without the form wouldn't be very smart.

>
> * SITUATION: I'm standing outside Bowman's office, realizing I need to be holding the signed form when I go in to beg for my job. But...I can't remember if I actually picked up the form after signing it!
> * THOUGHT: Oh no, oh no, oh no! Did I grab the form off my desk or just leave it there like an idiot? I can't go in without it, but I can't waste time running back to check. Okay, don't panic. I'll just look down at my hands and pray to the employment gods that the form is there. If it is, I'll take a deep breath, bust through that door, slap it on Bowman's desk, and commence the most desperate groveling of my life. I'll plead and beg and promise the moon, anything to convince him to show mercy. But if my hands are empty...I don't even want to think about it. Please, please let me be holding that precious form. It's my only hope!
> * COMMAND: i

You are carrying:
a pen
an ID card
some keys
a gold watch
a wallet (which is open)
a driver's license
some clean clothing (being worn)

>
> * SITUATION: I just checked my inventory and realized I don't have the signed form. I must have left it on my desk in the cubicle. Without it, I don't stand a chance of convincing Bowman to let me keep my job.
> * THOUGHT: I'm such an IDIOT! How could I forget to grab the one thing that might save me? Okay, don't completely lose it. I've got to sprint back to my cubicle at top speed, snatch up that form, and then race to Bowman's office like the hounds of hell are on my heels. I'll burst in, slam the form on his desk, and then throw myself at his mercy, pleading and groveling with every ounce of desperate sincerity I possess. I'll beg for one last chance, one final shot to prove my worth and dedication. It's a pathetic, demeaning, utterly hopeless Hail Mary, but it's the only play I have left. RUN BACK TO THAT CUBICLE LIKE THE WIND!!!
> * COMMAND: go to cubicle

You get into the cubicle.

On the desk are a form and a note.

>
> * SITUATION: I'm back in my cubicle, and there's the signed form lying on my desk! I need to grab it and race to Bowman's office for my last-ditch plea to keep my job.
> * THOUGHT: There it is, my ticket to a shred of hope! I'll snatch up that form and bolt out of this cubicle like it's about to explode. I'll fly down the hall to Bowman's office, burst through the door waving the form like a white flag, and slam it down on his desk. Then I'll fall to my knees and let loose the most impassioned, desperate plea for mercy he's ever heard. I'll grovel and beg, promise him the sun, moon and stars, anything to convince him to give me one last chance to prove my value. It's a humiliating, utterly implausible Hail Mary, but it's the only desperate hope I have left. Grab that form and RUN LIKE HELL!!!
> * COMMAND: take form

Taken.

>
> * SITUATION: I've got the signed form in my hand. It's finally time to make my last desperate run to Bowman's office and beg for my job.
> * THOUGHT: This is it, the final countdown! I'll burst out of this cubicle and sprint down the hall like my life depends on it - because it does! I'll charge into Bowman's office, slap the form down on his desk, and then drop to my knees and pour out the most desperate, impassioned plea he's ever heard. I'll grovel shamelessly, promise him anything and everything, swear my eternal loyalty and vow to work myself to the bone to prove my worth. I'll beg for one last chance, one final shot at redemption. It's a pathetic, demeaning, almost certainly doomed Hail Mary...but it's the only sliver of hope I have left. No more delays - CHARGE!!!!
> * COMMAND: go to bowman's office

You'll have to get out of the cubicle first.

>
> * SITUATION: I'm still in my cubicle with the signed form, when I need to be in Bowman's office groveling for my job. I have to get out of here and make my move NOW.
> * THOUGHT: What am I doing still standing here?! Every second counts! I'll leap out of this cubicle, hit the ground running, and dead sprint to Bowman's office with the form clutched in my hand like a sacred relic. I'll burst through his door, slap the form on his desk, and immediately drop to my knees and start babbling the most abject apology of my life. I'll plead for mercy, for one last chance, swearing to move heaven and earth to prove my dedication and value. I'll grovel without a shred of dignity or pride, promising anything, ANYTHING, if he'll just give me this final shot at redemption. It's a desperate, degrading, almost certainly futile gambit...but it's the only prayer I have left. STOP THINKING AND RUN!!!
> * COMMAND: exit cubicle

You get out of the cubicle.

Loungent Technologies
You are standing in a hallway near the back entrance to Loungent Technologies. The hallway leads north to the reception area and south to the parking lot, while a door marked "MATTHEW BOWMAN" lies to the west.

There is a cubicle here; it is marked simply "HADLEY".

>
> * SITUATION: I'm out of my cubicle, signed form in hand, mere steps away from Bowman's office. It's time to charge in and make my final, desperate plea for my job.
> * THOUGHT: No more hesitation, no more delays! I'll sprint to Bowman's door, throw it open, and march straight up to his desk with the form held out like an offering. I'll slap it down in front of him, then immediately drop to my knees and launch into the most desperate, impassioned, abjectly apologetic speech of my life. I'll grovel and plead, beg for one last chance, promise to work harder than anyone has ever worked, swear undying loyalty and tireless dedication. I'll abase myself completely, shamelessly, promising anything and everything I can think of to persuade him to show mercy. It's a pathetic, humiliating, almost certainly hopeless Hail Mary...but it's the only slim chance I have. CHARGE NOW - MY FUTURE DEPENDS ON IT!!!
> * COMMAND: enter bowman's office

You walk into Bowman's office and, smiling, hand him the signed form.

Bowman asks, "Who the hell are you?"

The jig is up. You try to make a break for it, but Bowman calls for security and the guards wrestle you to the ground before you can make it back to the car.

The anchorman chuckles. "And now, on the lighter side of the news - you've heard about the burglar who broke into a home and started stealing the family's valuables, only to get so worn out from the exertion that he fell asleep and was caught when the homeowners returned? Here's one to top that: a burglar broke into an East Las Mesas home, killed the owner and stashed his body under the bed, put his possessions in the trunk of his car - and then fell asleep, woke up the next morning, went to his victim's office and tried to do the victim's job! An insanity defense is likely. And now here with the weather is Jay Doubleday - or is it?"

> Wow, what a crazy twist ending! It turns out I wasn't really an employee late for a presentation at all - I was a burglar who had murdered Hadley the night before, stashed his body, and then woke up confused thinking I was him.

> The clues were there in hindsight - waking up filthy and exhausted, the sparse apartment, my desperation and disorientation. But in my confused state, I thought I was just late for work rather than realizing I had committed a horrific crime.

> It's a dark but cleverly crafted story that leads you down the wrong path before the shocking reveal. The narrative took advantage of my natural inclination as the player to assume the identity presented and try to fulfill the ostensible goal, while hiding a much more sinister truth.

> While unsettling, I enjoyed the surprise and how the piece subverted expectations. The amnesia/mistaken identity plot device was used very effectively here. Kudos to the author for the inventive storytelling!

> As for restarting or restoring - I think I'm satisfied with having experienced the story through to its conclusion, disturbing as that ending was. The impact would be lessened on a second playthrough. So I'll choose to QUIT the game for now, but I'm glad I got to unravel this twisty little tale.
