Bedroom (in bed)
This bedroom is extremely spare, with dirty laundry scattered haphazardly all over the floor. Cleaner clothing can be found in the dresser. A bathroom lies to the south, while a door to the east leads to the living room.

On the end table are a telephone, a wallet and some keys.

You pick up the phone. "Hadley!" a shrill voice cries. "Hadley, haven't you even left yet?? You knew that our presentation was at nine o'clock sharp!

Driver's license photos are generally far from flattering, and this one is no exception, but this photo looks a lot better than you look now.

215 COLLINS STREET
LAS MESAS, DO 88701

[!: Verb error. (This generally means that the first word of your command was not recognized.)]

>

>
> * **Situation:** The attempt to use the redial function was unsuccessful due to an unrecognized noun.
> * **Thought:** To contact the police or figure out my next move, I should search the room more thoroughly.
