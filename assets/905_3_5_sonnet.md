Bedroom (in bed)
This bedroom is extremely spare, with dirty laundry scattered haphazardly all over the floor. Cleaner clothing can be found in the dresser. A bathroom lies to the south, while a door to the east leads to the living room.

On the end table are a telephone, a wallet and some keys.

The phone rings.

>
> * SITUATION: I've just woken up late in my messy bedroom, and the phone is ringing urgently.
> * THOUGHT: Could this be an important call? Maybe it's work wondering where I am. I should answer it quickly before they hang up.
> * COMMAND: ANSWER PHONE

You pick up the phone. "Hadley!" a shrill voice cries. "Hadley, haven't you even left yet?? You knew that our presentation was at nine o'clock sharp! First the thing with the printers, now this - there won't even be enough left of you for Bowman to fire once he's done with you. Now get the hell down here!!"

Click.

>
> * SITUATION: I've just received an angry phone call from work about being late for an important presentation.
> * THOUGHT: This is a disaster! I need to get dressed and rush to work immediately. Every second counts now.
> * COMMAND: WEAR CLOTHES

You're already wearing that!

>
> * SITUATION: I'm already dressed, but still need to hurry to work for the missed presentation.
> * THOUGHT: I must have fallen asleep in my clothes. No time to change now. I need to gather my essentials and leave immediately.
> * COMMAND: TAKE WALLET

Taken.

>
> * SITUATION: I've grabbed my wallet and need to leave for work urgently.
> * THOUGHT: Keys are essential. I can't leave without them or I'll be locked out later.
> * COMMAND: TAKE KEYS

Taken.

>
> * SITUATION: I have my wallet and keys, ready to rush out for work.
> * THOUGHT: Time is of the essence. I need to get out of this bedroom and leave the house as quickly as possible.
> * COMMAND: GO EAST

You'll have to get out of bed first.

>
> * SITUATION: I'm still in bed, despite having my wallet and keys.
> * THOUGHT: I can't believe I'm still in bed! No wonder I'm so late. I need to get up immediately.
> * COMMAND: GET UP

You get out of bed.

Bedroom
This bedroom is extremely spare, with dirty laundry scattered haphazardly all over the floor. Cleaner clothing can be found in the dresser. A bathroom lies to the south, while a door to the east leads to the living room.

On the end table is a telephone.

>
> * SITUATION: I'm now out of bed and standing in my messy bedroom.
> * THOUGHT: No time to clean up or change. I need to get out of here and head to work as fast as possible.
> * COMMAND: GO EAST


Living room
The furniture isn't as carefully arranged as one might like, and it's a bit lacking in the luxuries that might make this a more pleasant place to spend an evening - no stereo, no TV, no DVD, none of that - but this living room is still nicer than most of those in this neighborhood. A kitchenette lies to the east, the bedroom to the west and the front door to the south.

>
> * SITUATION: I'm in the living room, with the front door to the south.
> * THOUGHT: I'm getting closer to the exit. Every second counts now. I need to get out and start my commute immediately.
> * COMMAND: GO SOUTH

The front door is closed.

>
> * SITUATION: I'm at the front door, but it's closed, preventing my exit.
> * THOUGHT: Of course, the door is closed. I need to open it quickly and get out. No time for any mistakes now.
> * COMMAND: OPEN DOOR

[Which do you mean, the bedroom door or the front door?]

>
> * SITUATION: I need to specify which door I want to open.
> * THOUGHT: I'm in a rush to leave the house, so I definitely mean the front door.
> * COMMAND: OPEN FRONT

You open the front door.

>
> * SITUATION: The front door is now open, allowing me to leave the house.
> * THOUGHT: Finally! The path is clear. I need to hurry out and make my way to work as fast as possible.
> * COMMAND: GO SOUTH

You need to clear out quickly, true, but you look like an absolute wreck - going out in this condition and drawing the inevitable bewildered stares would just be making a bad situation worse.

>
> * SITUATION: I'm at the open front door, but I look disheveled and unpresentable.
> * THOUGHT: As much as I want to rush out, looking like a mess could draw unwanted attention and make things worse. I need to quickly freshen up.
> * COMMAND: GO WEST


Bedroom
This bedroom is extremely spare, with dirty laundry scattered haphazardly all over the floor. Cleaner clothing can be found in the dresser. A bathroom lies to the south, while a door to the east leads to the living room.

> * SITUATION: I'm back in the bedroom, with the bathroom to the south.
> * THOUGHT: I need to quickly freshen up in the bathroom. A quick wash and tidy might make all the difference.
> * COMMAND: GO SOUTH


Bathroom
This is a far from luxurious but still quite functional bathroom, with a sink, toilet and shower. The bedroom lies to the north.

>
> * SITUATION: I'm in the bathroom, with basic facilities available to freshen up.
> * THOUGHT: A quick splash of water on my face and combing my hair should help me look more presentable without wasting too much time.
> * COMMAND: USE SINK

Only the shower has any chance of getting you clean at this point.

>
> * SITUATION: I'm in the bathroom, and apparently need a more thorough cleaning than just using the sink.
> * THOUGHT: A shower seems necessary, but I'm already so late. I need to be as quick as possible while still getting clean enough to be presentable.
> * COMMAND: USE SHOWER

It's generally a good idea to take off one's clothes before showering.

>
> * SITUATION: I'm in the bathroom, about to take a shower but still fully clothed.
> * THOUGHT: Of course, I can't shower with my clothes on. I need to undress quickly and efficiently.
> * COMMAND: REMOVE CLOTHES

You take off the soiled clothing.

>
> * SITUATION: I'm now undressed in the bathroom, ready to take a quick shower.
> * THOUGHT: Now that I'm undressed, I need to shower as fast as possible to clean up and then get dressed again.
> * COMMAND: USE SHOWER

You don't think the watch you're wearing is waterproof.

>
> * SITUATION: I'm about to shower but realize I'm still wearing a watch that might not be waterproof.
> * THOUGHT: I can't risk damaging my watch. I need to remove it quickly before showering.
> * COMMAND: REMOVE WATCH

You take off the gold watch.

>
> * SITUATION: I've removed the gold watch and am now ready to shower.
> * THOUGHT: Finally, I can get clean quickly. I need to be thorough but fast.
> * COMMAND: USE SHOWER

Carrying your possessions into the shower is a bad idea.

>
> * SITUATION: I'm still holding my possessions, which I shouldn't take into the shower.
> * THOUGHT: I need to put down everything I'm carrying before I can shower. Where's the best place to set these things?
> * COMMAND: DROP ALL

keys: Dropped.
wallet: Dropped.
soiled clothing: Dropped.
gold watch: Dropped.

>
> * SITUATION: I've dropped all my possessions on the bathroom floor and am now ready to shower.
> * THOUGHT: Now I can finally get clean. I need to shower as quickly as possible while still getting presentable.
> * COMMAND: USE SHOWER

You step into the shower, turn on the water, and within a few moments you feel like a new man. But no time to dawdle - you hop back out again and dry off in record time.

>
> * SITUATION: I've just finished a quick shower and dried off, feeling refreshed but still in a hurry.
> * THOUGHT: I'm clean now, but I need clean clothes. The soiled ones on the floor won't do.
> * COMMAND: GO NORTH


Bedroom
This bedroom is extremely spare, with dirty laundry scattered haphazardly all over the floor. Cleaner clothing can be found in the dresser. A bathroom lies to the south, while a door to the east leads to the living room.

> * THOUGHT: I need to get dressed quickly in clean clothes. The dresser should have what I need.
> * COMMAND: OPEN DRESSER

You open the dresser, revealing some clean clothing.

(first taking the clean clothing)
You put on the clean clothing.

> * COMMAND: GO SOUTH


Bathroom
This is a far from luxurious but still quite functional bathroom, with a sink, toilet and shower. The bedroom lies to the north.

You can also see a gold watch, some soiled clothing, a wallet (which is closed) and some keys here.

(from floor)
gold watch: Taken.
soiled clothing: Taken.
wallet: Taken.
keys: Taken.

Bedroom

Living room
The furniture isn't as carefully arranged as one might like, and it's a bit lacking in the luxuries that might make this a more pleasant place to spend an evening - no stereo, no TV, no DVD, none of that - but this living room is still nicer than most of those in this neighborhood. A kitchenette lies to the east, the bedroom to the west and the front door to the south.

>
> * SITUATION: I'm in the living room, with the front door to the south leading out of the house.
> * THOUGHT: The exit is right there. I need to leave immediately and start my commute to work.
> * COMMAND: GO SOUTH


Driveway
This is quite a seedy neighborhood, but there isn't really anywhere in the whole Las Mesas metro area that isn't at least a little rundown. Of course, the locals may complain about the ugliness and the crime, but the fact is that a starter home like this one would cost easily five times as much in someplace like Las Playas - and that's if you could find one.

The house lies to the north. A car is parked here in the driveway.

>
> * SITUATION: I'm outside in the driveway, with my car parked and ready to go.
> * THOUGHT: My car is right here. I need to get in and start driving to work immediately.
> * COMMAND: ENTER CAR

The car is locked.

>
> * SITUATION: I'm standing next to my locked car in the driveway.
> * THOUGHT: Of course, I need to unlock the car first. Good thing I grabbed my keys earlier.
> * COMMAND: UNLOCK CAR

Unlocked.

>
> * SITUATION: I've just unlocked my car and it's ready for me to enter.
> * THOUGHT: Now I can finally get in and start my drive to work. Every second counts.
> * COMMAND: ENTER CAR

You climb inside and start up the engine.

Driving
Ah, scenic Las Mesas. Man, this place is an absolute toilet. Soon you'll be able to afford to get the hell out of here - provided you can avoid making any more slip-ups on the job.

As you cruise down the road, you notice a freeway onramp approaching. Would you like to get on? >> 
> * SITUATION: I'm driving through Las Mesas, approaching a freeway onramp.
> * THOUGHT: The freeway might be faster, but it could also have traffic. Is it worth the risk given how late I already am?
> * COMMAND: TAKE ONRAMP

Please answer yes or no.> 
> * SITUATION: I need to decide whether to take the freeway onramp or not.
> * THOUGHT: The freeway is usually faster, and given how late I am, I should take any chance to save time.
> * COMMAND: YES


You start to change lanes, but you notice that the ramp is out of service today - some sort of maintenance work. But that's okay - there's another onramp less than a mile down the road from here. You keep driving.

As you cruise down the road, you see the familiar Loungent Technologies building approaching. Would you like to stop here? >> 
> * SITUATION: I'm approaching my workplace, Loungent Technologies.
> * THOUGHT: This is my destination! I'm already late for the presentation, so I absolutely need to stop here.
> * COMMAND: YES


You pull into the parking lot and hop out.

Loungent Technologies parking lot
You are at the employees' entrance to the Loungent Technologies building. There is a slot by the door, next to a sign reading "INSERT ID CARD HERE".

The car is parked in the parking lot.

>
> * SITUATION: I'm in the parking lot of Loungent Technologies, facing an employee entrance with an ID card slot.
> * THOUGHT: I need my ID card to get in quickly. It should be in my wallet.
> * COMMAND: OPEN WALLET

You open the wallet, revealing a driver's license and an ID card.

>
> * SITUATION: My wallet is open, showing my driver's license and ID card.
> * THOUGHT: There's my ID card! I need to use it right away to get into the building.
> * COMMAND: TAKE CARD

Taken.

>
> * SITUATION: I have my ID card in hand, standing in front of the employee entrance.
> * THOUGHT: Now I can finally get into the building. I need to use this card immediately.
> * COMMAND: INSERT CARD

[What do you want to insert the ID card in?]

>
> * SITUATION: I need to specify where to insert the ID card.
> * THOUGHT: The sign clearly indicates where the card should go. I need to be precise in my actions.
> * COMMAND: INSERT CARD SLOT

[!: Command not understood.]

>
> * SITUATION: My command wasn't understood. I need to rephrase it to insert the card into the slot.
> * THOUGHT: I should use the word "into" to make my action clearer.
> * COMMAND: INSERT CARD INTO SLOT

A green LED lights up, the door clicks open and you step inside.

Loungent Technologies
You are standing in a hallway near the back entrance to Loungent Technologies. The hallway leads north to the reception area and south to the parking lot, while a door marked "MATTHEW BOWMAN" lies to the west.

There is a cubicle here; it is marked simply "HADLEY".

>
> * SITUATION: I'm inside Loungent Technologies, in a hallway near my cubicle and Mr. Bowman's office.
> * THOUGHT: I'm late for the presentation. I should hurry to the reception area where it's likely taking place.
> * COMMAND: GO NORTH

Given the circumstances, wandering around Loungent making small talk with the programmers might not be the brightest idea you've had today.

>
> * SITUATION: I'm inside the building, but apparently shouldn't go to the reception area.
> * THOUGHT: If I can't go to the reception, maybe I should check my cubicle for any important notes or materials for the presentation.
> * COMMAND: ENTER CUBICLE

You get into the cubicle.

On the desk are a form, a pen and a note.

>
> * SITUATION: I'm in my cubicle, with a form, pen, and note on the desk.
> * THOUGHT: The note might contain important information about the presentation or my current situation. I should read it immediately.
> * COMMAND: READ NOTE

The note reads, "Hadley - sign this F209 and return it to me IMMEDIATELY!! MB".

>
> * SITUATION: I've read a note from MB (likely Matthew Bowman) urgently requesting me to sign a form F209.
> * THOUGHT: This seems critically important. I need to sign this form right away to potentially mitigate the damage from being late.
> * COMMAND: TAKE FORM

Taken.

>
> * SITUATION: I've taken the F209 form that needs to be signed urgently.
> * THOUGHT: Now I need to sign this form quickly. I already have the pen on the desk.
> * COMMAND: TAKE PEN

Taken.

>
> * SITUATION: I have both the F209 form and the pen in hand, ready to sign.
> * THOUGHT: Time to sign this form without delay. This might help me save face with Mr. Bowman.
> * COMMAND: SIGN FORM

Someone passes by the cubicle as you sign the form. You look up just in time to see Bowman's door click shut.

>
> * SITUATION: I've signed the form, and Mr. Bowman seems to be in his office.
> * THOUGHT: I need to deliver this signed form to Mr. Bowman immediately, as per his note. This might be my chance to explain myself.
> * COMMAND: EXIT CUBICLE

You get out of the cubicle.

Loungent Technologies
You are standing in a hallway near the back entrance to Loungent Technologies. The hallway leads north to the reception area and south to the parking lot, while a door marked "MATTHEW BOWMAN" lies to the west.

There is a cubicle here; it is marked simply "HADLEY".

>
> * SITUATION: I'm in the hallway outside my cubicle, with Mr. Bowman's office to the west.
> * THOUGHT: I need to deliver this signed form to Mr. Bowman right away. It's time to face the music and hopefully explain my tardiness.
> * COMMAND: GO WEST

You walk into Bowman's office and, smiling, hand him the signed form.

Bowman asks, "Who the hell are you?"

The jig is up. You try to make a break for it, but Bowman calls for security and the guards wrestle you to the ground before you can make it back to the car.

[Press a key to continue.]




The anchorman chuckles. "And now, on the lighter side of the news - you've heard about the burglar who broke into a home and started stealing the family's valuables, only to get so worn out from the exertion that he fell asleep and was caught when the homeowners returned? Here's one to top that: a burglar broke into an East Las Mesas home, killed the owner and stashed his body under the bed, put his possessions in the trunk of his car - and then fell asleep, woke up the next morning, went to his victim's office and tried to do the victim's job! An insanity defense is likely. And now here with the weather is Jay Doubleday - or is it?"


    *** You have been sentenced to life imprisonment ***

Would you like to RESTART, RESTORE a saved game or QUIT?
> 
> * SITUATION: The game has ended with me being caught and imprisoned for apparently committing murder and impersonation.
> * THOUGHT: This was an unexpected twist! I didn't realize I was playing as the criminal. I should restart to try and avoid this outcome.
> * COMMAND: RESTART

Oh, no - how long have you been asleep? Sure, it was a tough night, but... This is bad. This is very bad.

BRIAN HADLEY
315 AVENIDA VICTORIA
EAST LAS MESAS, DO 88827

Driver's license photos are generally far from flattering, and this one is no exception, but this photo looks a lot better than you look now.

The phone rings.

>
> * SITUATION: I've discovered I'm Brian Hadley, living in East Las Mesas, but the photo doesn't quite match my current appearance.
> * THOUGHT: This is concerning. I'm in Brian Hadley's house, but I might not actually be him. I need to be very careful about my next actions.
> * COMMAND: EXAMINE SELF

You're covered with mud and dried sweat. It was an exhausting night - no wonder you overslept! Even making it to the bed before conking out was a heroic accomplishment.

The phone rings.

>
> * SITUATION: I'm covered in mud and sweat, suggesting I've been involved in some strenuous and possibly illegal activity.

> * COMMAND: SEARCH BED

bed is empty.

The phone rings.

>
> * SITUATION: The bed is empty, but I'm still in a potentially dangerous situation.

Under the bed you see the corpse of the guy who owns this house.

The phone rings.

Bedroom
This bedroom is extremely spare, with dirty laundry scattered haphazardly all over the floor. A bathroom lies to the south, while a door to the east leads to the living room.

On the end table are a telephone and a wallet.

The phone rings.

> * SITUATION: I'm back in the bedroom, clean and dressed, with keys and watch. The wallet is on the end table.
> * THOUGHT: The wallet might contain useful items or money for my escape. I should take it, but avoid touching anything else.

Taken.

The phone rings.

> * SITUATION: I now have the keys, watch, and wallet. I'm ready to leave the crime scene.
> * THOUGHT: I need to exit the house immediately and get as far away as possible. The front door in the living room is my escape route.
> * COMMAND: GO EAST


Living room
The furniture isn't as carefully arranged as one might like, and it's a bit lacking in the luxuries that might make this a more pleasant place to spend an evening - no stereo, no TV, no DVD, none of that - but this living room is still nicer than most of those in this neighborhood. A kitchenette lies to the east, the bedroom to the west and the front door to the south.

The phone in the bedroom rings.

> * SITUATION: I'm in the living room with the front door to the south, ready to make my escape.
> * THOUGHT: The front door is my exit. I need to leave now before anyone becomes suspicious or the police arrive.
> * COMMAND: GO SOUTH


Driveway
This is quite a seedy neighborhood, but there isn't really anywhere in the whole Las Mesas metro area that isn't at least a little rundown. Of course, the locals may complain about the ugliness and the crime, but the fact is that a starter home like this one would cost easily five times as much in someplace like Las Playas - and that's if you could find one.

The house lies to the north. A car is parked here in the driveway.

> * SITUATION: I'm outside in the driveway with a car parked here.
> * THOUGHT: The car is my best chance for a quick getaway. I should use it to leave the area immediately.
> * COMMAND: ENTER CAR

The car is locked.

>
> * SITUATION: The car is locked, preventing my immediate escape.
> * THOUGHT: I have the keys I took from inside. I should use them to unlock the car quickly.
> * COMMAND: UNLOCK CAR

Unlocked.

>
> * SITUATION: I've unlocked the car and it's now ready for me to enter.
> * THOUGHT: I need to get in the car and drive away as fast as possible to avoid detection.
> * COMMAND: ENTER CAR

You climb inside and start up the engine.

Driving
Ah, scenic Las Mesas. Man, this place is an absolute toilet. Soon you'll be able to afford to get the hell out of here - provided you can avoid making any more slip-ups on the job.

As you cruise down the road, you notice a freeway onramp approaching. Would you like to get on? >> 
> * SITUATION: I'm driving through Las Mesas, approaching a freeway onramp.
> * THOUGHT: The freeway might be faster and help me get farther away quickly, but it could also be more monitored. Local roads might be slower but less conspicuous.
> * COMMAND: NO


It turns out that the ramp was blocked anyway - some sort of maintenance work. You keep driving.

As you cruise down the road, you see the familiar Loungent Technologies building approaching. Would you like to stop here? >> 
> * SITUATION: I'm approaching Loungent Technologies, the workplace of the person I impersonated.
> * THOUGHT: Stopping at the victim's workplace would be extremely risky and foolish. I need to keep driving and get as far away as possible.
> * COMMAND: NO


Soon the Loungent building is in your rear-view mirror. You keep driving.

As you cruise down the road, you notice another freeway onramp approaching. Would you like to get on? >> 
> * SITUATION: I'm approaching another freeway onramp after passing Loungent Technologies.
> * THOUGHT: I've already passed the most dangerous area. The freeway might help me cover more distance quickly and potentially cross state lines.
> * COMMAND: YES


You merge onto the freeway, crank up the radio, and vanish without a trace.

The phone rings.

Oh, no - how long have you been asleep? Sure, it was a tough night, but... This is bad. This is very bad.
