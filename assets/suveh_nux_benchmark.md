"Yes, master?"

You rush to your master's side and await his instructions. He is studying a fragile looking scroll and muttering to himself.

He looks up and says, "Ah, there you are. This ..." -- he hands you the scroll -- " ... goes back in the vault. I believe it is still open. And this little beastie ..." -- he hands you a small, empty brass cage -- "... goes back to my private quarters. Thank you, that will be all."

You bow, and head downstairs to the vault. The heavy stone door is wide open, and a golden key juts out of the lock.

Without warning, someone shoves you roughly from behind. The scroll and the brass cage fly out of your hands as you fall to the ground. There is a loud "click", and everything turns black.

Darkness
It is pitch dark, and you can't see a thing.

Which is not good.

(Type "about" for game information and special commands).

>
> look around

(It is not quite as dark as you thought. A sliver of light under the door provides a tiny amount of light, and your eyes begin to adjust to the near darkness ...)

Vault
There is plenty of room to move around, and the ceiling is quite high. You can just make out a shelf along one of the walls.

On the floor you can faintly see a brass cage and a scroll.

>
> take scroll

Taken.

>
> examine scroll

It's a fragile scroll. It is too dark to read what is on it.

>
> take cage

Taken. You notice that it has fallen open.

Something brushes past your foot.

>
> look down

It is quite difficult to see in the dark.

>
> search floor

You find no objects on the floor.

You can't find whatever it was that brushed past you.

>
> examine cage

You can feel it, but you can't see it very well in the dark.

>
> open door

The vault door won't budge.

You feel something nibbling on your shoe.

>
> kick shoe

You kick at your shoes, but whatever nibbled on your shoe is not there any more.

>
> examine shelf

The shelf seems to have some objects on it, but you can't clearly make them out.

>
> feel shelf

You stretch out your hand and feel your way along the shelf ... there is a piece of parchment, what feels like a leather bound book, a crystal or gemstone of some kind ...

Clunk! You knock over a small vial of liquid, which glows briefly with a dull green light. The glow soon fades away.

You noticed that the vial had a stopper, so nothing was spilled. (Fortunately for you; your master may have been upset if it had).

>
> take vial

Taken.

Something brushes past you again.

>
> open vial

Your remove the stopper from the vial, but the pungent vapours make you feel dizzy, so you replace it again.

>
> examine vial

You can't see it very well in the dark. It only glowed for a brief time.

>
> shake vial

You give the vial of liquid a vigorous shake, and it starts to glow with a faint, phosphorescent green light -- enough to get a better look at your surroundings.

Vault
You view your surroundings by the dull green glow of the liquid ...

On the shelf you can see a leather bound book, a piece of parchment and a crystal or gemstone.

>
> take book

Taken.

>
> examine book

The front cover of the book has the word "SPELLS" written vertically down the left side in silver letters. There is some other writing as well, but it's too dark to make out.

[To read the book, say "next/prev", "page <number>", or "open/close book".]

>

You open the book.

The first page says "Suveh Nux" down the left side in silver letters. There is some other writing as well, but it's too dark to make out.

The glow from the vial has faded to nothing, and you are in the dark once again.

The second page says "Aveh Tia" down the left side in silver letters.

You glimpse the words "very sophisticated" before the glow fades too much to read the rest of the page. The letters in silver remain visible.

>
> read parchment

>
> take crystal

Taken.

Something nibbles on your shoe.

>

A perfectly clear crystal with many facets, about the size of your fist and shaped like a teardrop. It looks quite beautiful in the faint green light.

You feel something brush against you again.

>

The first page says:

 Some ancient civilisations had a great
 understanding of the manifold and
 various sciences of the natural world,
 entirely in disagreement with certain
 historical surveyors who shall remain
 Nameless in the present work, but shall be
 understood by the algebraic designation
 x.

The first letter in each line is written in silver, spelling "Suveh Nux".

>
> next page

The second page says:

 Ancient races such as the Meohan, a
 very sophisticated and reasonable
 ethnic group indeed, possessed
 horological devices of such accurate
 Timing that they could predict
 imminent eclipses, conjunctions
 and other such astronomical phenomena.

The first letter in each line is written in silver, spelling "Aveh Tia".

>
> next page

The third page says:

 Another highly developed race of antiquity,
 vanquished by the Meohan, were the Sundar --
 exquisite workers in metal, gemstones and
 heated glass. Their susceptibility to the
 Meohan's warlike methods was only due to
 a civil war between rival noble families,
 devastating the nation's standing army
 at a very inopportune time; their enemies
 had a distinct numerical advantage as a result.

The first letter in each line is written in silver, spelling "Aveh Madah".
